❖ Description: Build a chat application with a general room where every user will send
and receive messages.

>Only registered users can send messages in the general room, visitors can only read the
messages.

>Implement front-end and back-end functionalities, including user interface design & data
storage.

>Build the chat application with a responsive user interface and a database for storing the history of
messages, users and datetime.

>You are free to use any programming language, framework and database.

>Note: If you use any framework please don't use the built-in registration system. (PS: But I used the Google sign-in because I need to implement visitors/guests mode)
